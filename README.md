# Flask Basics

Welcome to the **Flask Basics** repository! This repo contains a collection of simple Flask applications to help strengthen your understanding of Flask, a popular Python web framework. These apps are designed to cover the fundamental concepts and can be a valuable resource for beginners looking to practice and understand how Flask works.

## Introduction

Flask is a lightweight Python web framework that allows you to quickly build web applications. This repository contains a set of simple projects and examples to help you get started with Flask and understand the core principles of web development.

## **Workflow**

1. **Request**: Client sends an HTTP request to the Flask server.
2. **Routing**: Flask matches the URL to the defined routes.
3. **View Function**: Flask invokes the corresponding view function associated with the route.
4. **Process**: The view function processes the request (interacts with the data source and renders the templates).
5. **Response**: Flask generates the response and sends it back to the client.
